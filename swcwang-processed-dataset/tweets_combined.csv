1601,"Anyway, I walk around the house, and I try not to look at things, try not to think of her. But that's all I can do. All I do is feel this deep pain, this deep longing. I see her again. I remember when I was in Germany, and she left. "

1607,"And I walk around the house and sometimes I think just momentarily that she'll be back to take care of this or that. And I realize she'll never be back. She didn't go away on a trip. She didn't go away on vacation, she's not at work. She didn't go to the store. "

1610,"I walk around the house and I see things of Debbie and I think of her. I think of the pain she went through, suffered for so long. All those procedures she went through. Between finding out she had cancer and the pain. Having chemotherapy for a long time. "
1611,"She would have some understanding. But noone, noone is there. People have their own lives and their own busy schedules. I have nothing but time. Time to think about what I used to have and what I no longer do have. I think, if I could only be with her again. "
1612,"No matter how hard I try, I cannot force her memories from my mind. As much I loved and love her, I don't want to think about how much I miss her. She was the person I need the most when I feel this way. She would talk to me, she would spend time with me. "
